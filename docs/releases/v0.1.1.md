## What's New

- Generated stubs now written to `.zvelte-check/` directory instead of alongside source files, avoiding conflicts with parallel linters like Biome

## Upgrade Notes

Add `.zvelte-check/` to your project's `.gitignore`:

```bash
echo '.zvelte-check/' >> .gitignore
```

## Installation

```bash
brew install ampcode/tap/zvelte-check
```
